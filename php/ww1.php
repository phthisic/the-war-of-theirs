            <div id="ww1-introduction">World War I began in 1914 after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
                and lasted until 1918.
                During the conflict, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire (the Central Powers)
                fought against Great Britain,
                France, Russia, Italy, Romania, Japan and the United States (the Allied Powers). Thanks to new
                military technologies and the horrors
                of trench warfare, World War I saw unprecedented levels of carnage and destruction. By the time the
                war was over and the Allied
                Powers claimed victory, more than 16 million people—soldiers and civilians alike—were dead.</div>
